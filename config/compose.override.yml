# Docker Compose override for Business Central authentication configuration
# This file is merged with BCDevOnLinux's compose.yml to override settings
#
# Purpose: Set ClientServicesCredentialType to NavUserPassword for Basic auth
# This allows the OData API to authenticate with username/password instead of Windows auth
#
# Usage: Copy this file to the BCDevOnLinux directory before running docker compose

services:
  bc:
    volumes:
      # Override the default CustomSettings.config with our NavUserPassword version
      # The config file is copied to /home/CustomSettings.config in the Dockerfile
      # and then copied to the BC Server directory on container start
      - ./CustomSettings.override.config:/home/CustomSettings.config:ro
